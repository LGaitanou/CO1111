<h1>Available Treasure Hunts:</h1>
<h3>Chose a treasure hunt and start! In a treasure hunt you will need to answer questions to rack up points!
    Do not worry about the difficulty. Some questions will have hints and some will be skippable as well, but you will
    lose points if you do that. Keep also in mind that you will have a limited amount of time to complete the Hunt. At the end,
    you will be ranked against other teams, so aim for a high score! Now, Onwards, to Victory!</h3>
